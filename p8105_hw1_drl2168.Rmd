# Problem 1

```{r load packages, message = FALSE}
# I initially installed this package, but now have commented it out
# install.packages('moderndive')

library(moderndive)
```

Now I will load the dataset for this problem and pull some basic information about it.

```{r data import}

data("early_january_weather")

```
